# Travel Insurance Prediction
The task for this work is to analyse the Travel Insurance Prediction dataset. The task is to predict whether a given customer would like to buy the insurance package. I will apply what I have learned about Machine Learning to complete this task.

Objectives for this work:

Practice working with CSV files. Practice performing EDA. Practice applying statistical inference procedures. Practice using linear machine learning models. Practice visualizing data with Matplotlib & Seaborn. Practice reading data, performing queries and filtering data using Pandas. Download the given dataset and check the overall information: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tejashvi14/travel-insurance-prediction-data

Used libraries:
Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, xgboost, numpy.
For ML modeling used models: LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier, SVC, DecisionTreeClassifier, GaussianNB, RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, XGBClassifier, XGBRFClassifier.

Conclusions:
Based on the available data for 2017-2019 year and a limited number of entries (1987), we are able to present the following estimates:

Travel insurance salespeople should target possible customers over 30 years of age, working in the private sector (average salary is 1016 000), who do not suffer from chronic diseases, are not frequent flyers, and mostly fly on local routes. Of the selected models, the XGBRFClassifier had the best features with 83.59% accuracy. It is hoped that more data would improve the result, but for now it is not a bad tool for the salesman.
